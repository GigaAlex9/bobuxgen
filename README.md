# linkvertise-abuse
*Make money from abusing Linkvertise's malvertising system*

__Step 1__<br>
Go to https://publisher.linkvertise.com and create a new account. Switch the language to English and make any required changes now.
<br>

__Step 2__<br>
Fork this github repository and enable github pages. This can be toggled by going to settings > pages > branch "main" and save. Do not use a template.
<br>

__Step 3__<br>
Go back to Linkvertise Publisher and create a new link. This time it should be your forked redirector, so for example, mine would be<br>
`https://serfderp.github.io/linkvertise-abuse/redirect` - just replace "serfderp" with your username.<br>

__Step 4__<br>
Now, open the forked repo in github. Click on the redirect folder, then index.html. Simply change <code>new_url</code> to your newly-created Linkvertise.
<br>

__Step 5__<br>
You've now completed the steps! Visit the linkvertise created and continue these tasks repeatedly, possibly under a vpn/proxy if possible.<br><br>

If you still need help, check out the example page under the redirect folder.
